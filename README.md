## Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
This Project aims to find the truthfullness of a News baesd on trained datasets.

## About
Fake news detection using machine learning is an application that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify news articles as either fake or real. This technology has gained significant importance due to the rapid spread of misinformation, especially on digital platforms. By analyzing linguistic patterns, source credibility, and other features, ML models can help distinguish between legitimate and misleading content.

## Features
-Linguistic Features
-Semantic Features
-Stylometric Features
-Source-based Features
-Contextual Features
-Temporal Features

## Requirements

* Data Requirements: The first and foremost requirement is high-quality, labeled data for training, validating, and testing the machine learning models.
* Computational Resources: Machine learning models, particularly deep learning-based models for fake news detection, can be resource-intensive.
* Software Requirements: implement a fake news detection system, several libraries and frameworks are essential for data processing, machine learning model development, and deployment.
* Feature Engineering: A key part of any machine learning system is feature extraction and engineering.
* Modeling and Training: The machine learning model should be selected and trained based on the features extracted from the data.
* Deployment: After model training and evaluation, the fake news detection system needs to be deployed for real-time or batch processing.
* Ethical and Legal Considerations:  Fake news detection models can inadvertently inherit biases from the training data.

Detection Accuracy:75%-85%


## Results and Impact
```
Result:
Machine learning algorithms are well-suited for handling vast amounts of news content and social media posts,
a scale that would be impossible for humans to process manually. This makes fake news detection much more efficient at scale.

Impact:
Fake news can cause a range of issues, from public panic to political manipulation.
The detection of fake news helps mitigate these consequences by limiting the spread of false information.
For example, in health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic,fake news can cause harm by spreading misleading medical advice or fake cures.
